# Blocky
A fun multiplatform 2D game built using the Unity game engine. (Bitcamp 2017 Project)
Blocky is currently available for PC, Mac, or on the web! (http://www.blockgame.com/) In addition, we are deploying to mobile (iOS and Android) very soon thanks to Unity's being a powerful cross-platform game engine.
The game is still currently in development with a current version of Beta v1.2.3.

In Blocky, you play as Blocky, a vibrant green square who fights for all that is good in an eternal struggle in a world overcome by a swarm of red squares, blue bombs (coming soon), and other surprises. The goal is simple; avoid the red enemies for as long as you can and rack up the highest score! Although the game is fairly simple at this point, there are plenty of features we are excited to implement in the near future and showcase to the public. Thank you for taking the time to look at our project and our team is looking forward to any and all feedback as well as the future of the game.
